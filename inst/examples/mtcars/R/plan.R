# Bootstrapping involves randomness, so this is good practice
# in real life. But this is a miniaturized workflow,
# so we will not use replicates here.

# This is a wildcard template for generating more commands.
# These new commands will apply our regression models
# to each of the datasets in turn.

#   values = my_datasets$target)

# Now, we summarize each regression fit of each bootstrapped dataset.
# We will look at these summaries to figure out if fuel efficiency
# and weight are related somehow.
# Again, this is a template. Later we will expand it over the
# available regression models.

# summaries() also uses evaluate(): once with expand = TRUE,
#   once with expand = FALSE

# Use `knitr_in()` to tell drake to look for dependencies
# inside report.Rmd (targets referenced explicitly with loadd() and readd()
# in active code chunks).
# Use file_out() to tell drake that the target is a file.
# Drake knows to put report.md in the "target" column when it comes
# time to make().
