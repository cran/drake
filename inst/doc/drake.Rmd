# Data frames in R for [Make](http://kbroman.org/minimal_make/)

Drake is a workflow manager and build system for

1. [Reproducibility](https://CRAN.R-project.org/view=ReproducibleResearch).
2. [High-performance computing](https://CRAN.R-project.org/view=HighPerformanceComputing).

Organize your work in a data frame. Then `make()` it.

```{r firstintroindrake}
library(drake)
load_basic_example() # Also (over)writes report.Rmd.
my_plan              # Each target is a file (single-quoted) or object.
```

```{r makedrakenoevalrmd, eval = FALSE}
make(my_plan) # Run the commands to build the targets.
```

# Installation

```{r devinstall, eval = FALSE}
install.packages("drake") # latest CRAN release
devtools::install_github(
  "wlandau-lilly/drake@v4.2.0",
  build = TRUE
) # GitHub release
devtools::install_github("wlandau-lilly/drake", build = TRUE) # dev version
```

For `make(..., parallelism = "Makefile")`, Windows users need to download and install [`Rtools`](https://cran.r-project.org/bin/windows/Rtools/).

# Quickstart

```{r quickstartdrakermd, eval = FALSE}
library(drake)
load_basic_example() # Also (over)writes report.Rmd.
plot_graph(my_plan)  # Hover, click, drag, zoom, pan.
outdated(my_plan)    # Which targets need to be (re)built?
missed(my_plan)      # Are you missing anything from your workspace?
check(my_plan)       # Are you missing files? Is your workflow plan okay?
make(my_plan)        # Run the workflow.
outdated(my_plan)    # Everything is up to date.
plot_graph(my_plan)  # The graph also shows what is up to date.
```

Dive deeper into the built-in examples.

```{r examplesdrakermd, eval = FALSE}
example_drake("basic") # Write the code files of the canonical tutorial.
examples_drake()       # List the other examples.
vignette("quickstart") # See https://cran.r-project.org/package=drake/vignettes
```

# Useful functions

Besides `make()`, here are some useful functions to learn about drake,

```{r learndrakermd, eval = FALSE}

```

set up your workflow plan,

```{r plandrakermd, eval = FALSE}

speed up your project with parallel computing,

```{r speeddrakermd, eval = FALSE}
make() # with jobs > 2

# Help and troubleshooting

# Reproducibility

There is room to improve the conversation and the landscape of reproducibility in the R and Statistics communities. At a more basic level than scientific replicability, literate programming, and version control, reproducibility carries an implicit promise that the alleged results of an analysis really do match the code. Drake helps keep this promise by tracking the relationships among the components of the analysis, a rare and effective approach that also saves time.

```{r reproducibilitydrakermd, eval = FALSE}
library(drake)
load_basic_example()
outdated(my_plan) # Which targets need to be (re)built?
make(my_plan)     # Build what needs to be built.
outdated(my_plan) # Everything is up to date.
# Change one of your functions.
reg2 <- function(d) {
  d$x3 <- d$x ^ 3
  lm(y ~ x3, data = d)
}
outdated(my_plan)   # Some targets depend on reg2().
plot_graph(my_plan) # Set targets_only to TRUE for smaller graphs.
make(my_plan)       # Rebuild just the outdated targets.
outdated(my_plan)   # Everything is up to date again.
plot_graph(my_plan) # The colors changed in the graph.
```

Similarly to imported functions like `reg2()`, `drake` reacts to changes in

1. Other imported functions, whether user-defined or from packages.
1. For imported functions from your environment, any nested functions also in your environment or from packages.
1. Commands in your workflow plan data frame.
1. Global variables mentioned in the commands or imported functions.
1. Upstream targets.
1. For [dynamic knitr reports](https://yihui.name/knitr/) (with `knit('your_report.Rmd')` as a command in your workflow plan data frame), targets and imports mentioned in calls to `readd()` and `loadd()` in the code chunks to be evaluated. `Drake` treats these targets and imports as dependencies of the compiled output target (say, `report.md`).

See the `quickstart` vignette for demonstrations of `drake`'s reproducibility and reactivity.

```{r drakermdquickvignette, eval = FALSE}
vignette("quickstart")
```

You can enhance reprodubility beyond the scope of `drake`. [Packrat](https://rstudio.github.io/packrat) creates a tightly-controlled local library of packages to extend the shelf life of your project. And with [Docker](https://www.docker.com/), you can execute your project on a [virtual machine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virtual_machine) to ensure platform independence. Together, [packrat](https://rstudio.github.io/packrat) and [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) can help others reproduce your work even if they have different software and hardware.

# High-performance computing

Similarly to [Make](https://www.gnu.org/software/make/), drake arranges the intermediate steps of your workflow in a dependency web. This network is the key to drake's parallel computing. For example, consider the network graph of the basic example.

```{r basicgraph}
library(drake)
load_basic_example()
make(my_plan, jobs = 2, verbose = FALSE) # Parallelize with 2 jobs.
# Change one of your functions.
reg2 <- function(d){
  d$x3 <- d$x ^ 3
  lm(y ~ x3, data = d)
}
```

```{r fakegraphdrakermd, eval = FALSE}
# Hover, click, drag, zoom, and pan.
plot_graph(my_plan, width = "100%", height = "500px")
```

src = "https://cdn.rawgit.com/wlandau-lilly/drake/98a49f04/images/reg2.html"
width = "100%" height = "600px" allowtransparency="true"
style="border: none; box-shadow: none">
</iframe>


When you call `make(my_plan, jobs = 4)`, the work proceeds in chronological order from left to right. The items are built or imported column by column in sequence, and up-to-date targets are skipped. Within each column, the targets/objects are all independent of each other conditional on the previous steps, so they are distributed over the 4 available parallel jobs/workers. Assuming the targets are rate-limiting (as opposed to imported objects), the next `make(..., jobs = 4)` should be faster than `make(..., jobs = 1)`, but it would be superfluous to use more than 4 jobs. See function `max_useful_jobs()` to suggest the number of jobs, taking into account which targets are already up to date.

As for the implementation, you can choose from multiple built-in parallel backends, including `parLapply()`, `mclapply()`, and [`Makefiles`](https://www.gnu.org/software/make/), the last of which can be tweaked to distribute targets to different jobs on a cluster. Please see the `parallelism` vignette for details.

# Acknowledgements and related work

The original idea of a time-saving reproducible build system extends back decades to [GNU Make](http://kbroman.org/minimal_make/), which today helps [data scientists](http://blog.kaggle.com/2012/10/15/make-for-data-scientists/) as well as the original user base of complied-language programmers. More recently, [Rich FitzJohn](http://richfitz.github.io/) created [remake](https://github.com/richfitz/remake), a breakthrough reimagining of [Make](http://kbroman.org/minimal_make/) for R and the most important inspiration for drake. Drake is a fresh reinterpretation of some of  [remake](https://github.com/richfitz/remake)'s pioneering fundamental concepts, scaled up for computationally-demanding workflows. There are [many other pipeline toolkits](https://github.com/pditommaso/awesome-pipeline), but few are R-focused.

Thanks also to [Kirill M&uuml;ller](http://krlmlr.github.io/) and [Daniel Falster](http://danielfalster.com/). They contributed code patches and enhancement ideas to my [parallelRemake](https://github.com/wlandau/parallelRemake) and [remakeGenerator](https://github.com/wlandau/remakeGenerator) packages, which I have now subsumed into drake.

Special thanks to [Jarad Niemi](http://www.jarad.me/), my advisor from [graduate school](http://stat.iastate.edu/), for first introducing me to the idea of [Makefiles](https://www.gnu.org/software/make/) for research. It took several months to convince me, and I am glad he succeeded.

In the sphere of reproducibility, drake and [remake](https://github.com/richfitz/remake) are examples of non-literate programming tools (as opposed to literate programming tools such as [knitr](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=knitr)). Counterparts include [R.cache](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=R.cache), [archivist](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=archivist), [trackr](https://github.com/gmbecker/recordr), and [memoise](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=memoise). See the [reproducible research CRAN task view](https://CRAN.R-project.org/view=ReproducibleResearch) for a more comprehensive list. Drake differentiates itself from these tools with its ability to track the relationships among cached objects and its extensive high-performance computing functionality.
