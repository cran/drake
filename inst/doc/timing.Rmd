# Build times

Thanks to [Jasper Clarkberg](https://github.com/dapperjapper), `drake` records how long it takes to build each target.

```{r timing_intro}
library(drake)
load_basic_example() # Get the code with drake_example("basic").
make(my_plan, jobs = 2, verbose = FALSE) # See also max_useful_jobs(my_plan).

build_times(digits = 8) # From the cache.

build_times(digits = 8, targets_only = TRUE)
```

For `drake` version 4.1.0 and earlier, `build_times()` just measures the elapsed runtime of each command in `my_plan$command`. For later versions, the build times also account for all the internal operations in `drake:::build()`, such as [storage and hashing](https://github.com/ropensci/drake/blob/master/vignettes/storage.Rmd).

# Predicting runtime

Drake uses these times to predict the runtime of the next `make()`. At this moment, everything is up to date in the current example, so the next `make()` should be fast. Here, we only factor in the times of the targets (excluding the imports using `targets_only = TRUE`).

```{r predict_runtime}
config <- drake_config(my_plan, verbose = FALSE)
predict_runtime(
  config,
  digits = 8,
  targets_only = TRUE
)
```

But you can also predict the elapsed time of a full runthrough scratch (either after `clean()` or with `make(..., trigger = "always")`).

```{r predict_runtime_scratch}
predict_runtime(
  config,
  from_scratch = TRUE,
  digits = 8,
  targets_only = TRUE
)
```

Suppose we change a dependency to make some targets out of date. Now, even though `from_scatch` is `FALSE`, the next `make()` should take some time.

```{r changedep_timing}
reg2 <- function(d){
  d$x3 <- d$x ^ 3
  lm(y ~ x3, data = d)
}

predict_runtime(
  config,
  digits = 8,
  targets_only = TRUE
)
```

We can also factor in parallelism using the `future_jobs` argument, which is just `jobs` for a hypothetical next `make()`.

```{r future_jobs}
predict_runtime(
  config,
  future_jobs = 1,
  from_scratch = TRUE,
  digits = 8,
  targets_only = TRUE
)

predict_runtime(
  config,
  future_jobs = 2,
  from_scratch = TRUE,
  digits = 8,
  targets_only = TRUE
)

predict_runtime(
  config,
  future_jobs = 4,
  from_scratch = TRUE,
  digits = 8,
  targets_only = TRUE
)
```

# Rate-limiting targets

To predict the next runtime with multiple parallel jobs, `drake` makes some assumptions.

1. The outdated targets are spread out evenly over the available jobs.
1. One job gets all the slowest targets (pessimistic scenario).

Then, `drake` simply takes the targets from the slowest job in each parallelizable stage and sums the corresponding elapsed build times. A parallelizable stage is a usually a column in the workflow graph, but if there are up-to-date targets in a column, `drake` skips ahead to try to fit as many targets as possible in a stage.

```{r faketiminggraph, eval = FALSE}
# Hover, click, drag, zoom, and pan.
vis_drake_graph(my_plan, width = "100%", height = "500px")
```

You can explore the rate-limiting targets

```{r rate_limiting_targets}
rate_limiting_times(
  config,
  from_scratch = TRUE,
  digits = 8,
  targets_only = TRUE
)

rate_limiting_times(
  config,
  future_jobs = 2,
  from_scratch = TRUE,
  digits = 8,
  targets_only = TRUE
)

rate_limiting_times(
  config,
  future_jobs = 4,
  from_scratch = TRUE,
  digits = 8,
  targets_only = TRUE
)
```

and the parallelizable stages in general.

```{r timingstages}
parallel_stages(config, from_scratch = TRUE)
```

# A word of caution

`Drake` only accounts for the targets with logged build times. If some targets have not been timed, `drake` throws a warning and lists the names of the untimed targets.

```{r endofline_timing, echo = F}
clean(destroy = TRUE, verbose = FALSE)
unlink(c("Makefile", "report.Rmd", "shell.sh", "STDIN.o*", "Thumbs.db"))
```
