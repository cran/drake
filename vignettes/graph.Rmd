`Drake` has powerful visuals to help you plan your project. You can generate an interactive workflow network with either `drake_graph()` or `vis_drake_graph()`. Then click, drag, hover, zoom, and pan. Use either the mouse or the green buttons near the bottom.


# Dependency reactivity

Initially, your entire project is out of date.

```{r graphoutdated}
library(drake)
load_basic_example() # Get the code with drake_example("basic").
config <- drake_config(my_plan)
vis_drake_graph(config) # Same as drake_graph()
```

width = "100%" height = "600px" allowtransparency="true"
style="border: none; box-shadow: none">
</iframe>


After `make()`, the whole project is all caught up.

```{r graphmake}
config <- make(my_plan, jobs = 4, verbose = FALSE)
vis_drake_graph(config)
```

<iframe
src = "https://cdn.rawgit.com/ropensci/drake/0b76e536/images/built.html"
width = "100%" height = "600px" allowtransparency="true"
style="border: none; box-shadow: none">
</iframe>


But when you change a dependency, some targets are out of date until the next `make(my_plan)`.

```{r reg2graphvisual}
reg2 <- function(d){
  d$x3 <- d$x ^ 3
  lm(y ~ x3, data = d)
}
vis_drake_graph(config)
```

<iframe
src = "https://cdn.rawgit.com/ropensci/drake/0b76e536/images/reg2.html"
width = "100%" height = "600px" allowtransparency="true"
style="border: none; box-shadow: none">

# Subgraphs

Graphs can grow enormous for serious projects, so there are multiple ways to focus on a manageable subgraph. The most brute-force way is to just pick a manual `subset` of nodes. However, with the `subset` argument, `vis_drake_graph()` may drop intermediate nodes and edges.

```{r subsetgraph}
vis_drake_graph(config, subset = c("regression2_small", "'report.md'"))
```

<iframe
src = "https://cdn.rawgit.com/ropensci/drake/0b76e536/images/subset.html"
width = "100%" height = "600px" allowtransparency="true"
style="border: none; box-shadow: none">
</iframe>

The rest of the subgraph functionality preserves connectedness. Use `targets_only` to ignore the imports.

```{r targetsonly}
vis_drake_graph(config, targets_only = TRUE)
```

<iframe
src = "https://cdn.rawgit.com/ropensci/drake/0b76e536/images/targetsonly.html"
width = "100%" height = "600px" allowtransparency="true"
style="border: none; box-shadow: none">
</iframe>


Similarly, you can just show downstream nodes.

```{r fromout}
vis_drake_graph(config, from = c("regression2_small", "regression2_large"))
```

<iframe
src = "https://cdn.rawgit.com/ropensci/drake/0b76e536/images/fromout.html"
width = "100%" height = "600px" allowtransparency="true"
style="border: none; box-shadow: none">
</iframe>


Or upstream ones.

```{r fromin}
vis_drake_graph(config, from = "small", mode = "in")
```

<iframe
src = "https://cdn.rawgit.com/ropensci/drake/0b76e536/images/fromin.html"
width = "100%" height = "600px" allowtransparency="true"
style="border: none; box-shadow: none">
</iframe>

In fact, let us just take a small neighborhood around a target in both directions.


```{r fromall}
vis_drake_graph(config, from = "small", mode = "all", order = 1)
```

<iframe
src = "https://cdn.rawgit.com/ropensci/drake/0b76e536/images/fromall.html"
width = "100%" height = "600px" allowtransparency="true"
style="border: none; box-shadow: none">
</iframe>

The `report.md` node is drawn in somewhat, but it is still the farthest to the right in order to communicate `drake`'s parallel computing strategy. 

# Parallel computing laid bare

`Drake` shows its parallel computing strategy plainly in the graph.

<iframe
src = "https://cdn.rawgit.com/ropensci/drake/0b76e536/images/reg2.html"

</iframe>

The nodes in each column above are conditionally independent given the dependencies to the left. So in general, the targets and imports are processed column by column from left to right, and everything within a column is executed in parallel. When some targets are already up to date, `drake` searches ahead in the graph to maximize the number of outdated targets in each parallelizable stage.

To show the parallelizable stages of the next `make()` programmatically, use the `parallel_stages()` function. All the targets/imports in a stage are processed in parallel before moving on to the next stage.


# Finer control

We have only scratched the surface of `vis_drake_graph()`. The help files (`?vis_drake_graph`) document much more functionality. In particular, the `dataframes_graph()` and `render_drake_graph()` functions let you customize your own [visNetwork graph](http://datastorm-open.github.io/visNetwork/).
