\usage{
workflow(..., list = character(0), file_targets = FALSE,
  strings_in_dots = c("filenames", "literals"))
}
\arguments{
\item{...}{same as for \code{drake::\link{workplan}()}}

\item{list}{same as for \code{drake::\link{workplan}()}}

\item{file_targets}{same as for \code{drake::\link{workplan}()}}

}
\value{
data frame of targets and command
}
\description{
Turns a named collection of command/target pairs into
a workflow plan data frame for \code{\link{make}} and
\code{\link{check}}.
}
\details{
A workflow plan data frame is a data frame
with a \code{target} column and a \code{command} column.
Targets are the objects and files that drake generates,
and commands are the pieces of R code that produce them.

For file inputs and targets, drake uses single quotes.
Double quotes are reserved for ordinary strings.
The distinction is important because drake thinks about
how files, objects, targets, etc. depend on each other.
Quotes in the \code{list} argument are left alone,
but R messes with quotes when it parses the free-form
arguments in \code{...}, so use the \code{strings_in_dots}
argument to control the quoting in \code{...}.

\examples{
# workflow() is deprecated. Use workplan() instead.
workplan(small = simulate(5), large = simulate(50))
workplan(list = c(x = "1 + 1", y = "sqrt(x)"))
workplan(data = readRDS("my_data.rds"))
workplan(my_file.rds = saveRDS(1+1, "my_file.rds"), file_targets = TRUE,
  strings_in_dots = "literals")
