  config,
  targets = NULL,

}
\arguments{
\item{config}{Optional internal runtime parameter list of
produced by both \code{\link[=make]{make()}} and
\code{\link[=drake_config]{drake_config()}}.}

\item{targets}{Character vector, names of targets.
Predict the runtime of building these targets
plus dependencies.
Defaults to all targets.}

\item{from_scratch}{Logical, whether to predict a
\code{\link[=make]{make()}} build from scratch or to
take into account the fact that some targets may be
already up to date and therefore skipped.}

\item{targets_only}{Deprecated.}

\item{jobs}{The \code{jobs} argument of your next planned
\code{make()}. How many targets to do you plan
to have running simultaneously?}

\item{known_times}{A named numeric vector with targets/imports
as names and values as hypothetical runtimes in seconds.
Use this argument to overwrite any of the existing build times
or the \code{default_time}.}

\item{default_time}{Number of seconds to assume for any
target or import with no recorded runtime (from \code{\link[=build_times]{build_times()}})
or anything in \code{known_times}.}

\item{warn}{Logical, whether to warn the user about
any targets with no available runtime, either in
\code{known_times} or \code{\link[=build_times]{build_times()}}. The times for these
targets default to \code{default_time}.}
}
\value{
A data frame showing one likely arrangement
of targets assigned to parallel workers.
