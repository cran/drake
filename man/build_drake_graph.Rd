}
\arguments{
\item{plan}{Workflow plan data frame.
A workflow plan data frame is a data frame
with a \code{target} column and a \code{command} column.
(See the details in the \code{\link[=drake_plan]{drake_plan()}} help file
for descriptions of the optional columns.)
Targets are the objects that drake generates,
and commands are the pieces of R code that produce them.
You can create and track custom files along the way
(see \code{\link[=file_in]{file_in()}}, \code{\link[=file_out]{file_out()}}, and \code{\link[=knitr_in]{knitr_in()}}).
Use the function \code{\link[=drake_plan]{drake_plan()}} to generate workflow plan
data frames.}

\item{targets}{Character vector, names of targets to build.
Dependencies are built too. You may supply static and/or whole
dynamic targets, but no sub-targets.}

\item{envir}{Environment to use. Defaults to the current
workspace, so you should not need to worry about this
most of the time. A deep copy of \code{envir} is made,
so you don't need to worry about your workspace being modified
by \code{make}. The deep copy inherits from the global environment.
Wherever necessary, objects and functions are imported
from \code{envir} and the global environment and
then reproducibly tracked as dependencies.}

\item{verbose}{Integer, control printing to the console/terminal.
\itemize{
\item \code{0}: print nothing.
\item \code{1}: print target-by-target messages as \code{\link[=make]{make()}} progresses.
\item \code{2}: show a progress bar to track how many targets are
done so far.
}}

\item{jobs}{Maximum number of parallel workers for processing the targets.
You can experiment with \code{\link[=predict_runtime]{predict_runtime()}}
to help decide on an appropriate number of jobs.

\item{console_log_file}{Deprecated in favor of \code{log_make}.}

\item{trigger}{Name of the trigger to apply to all targets.
Ignored if \code{plan} has a \code{trigger} column.
See \code{\link[=trigger]{trigger()}} for details.}

\item{cache}{drake cache as created by \code{\link[=new_cache]{new_cache()}}.
See also \code{\link[=drake_cache]{drake_cache()}}.}
}
\value{
An \code{igraph} object.
}
\description{
Use \code{\link[=drake_config]{drake_config()}} instead.
