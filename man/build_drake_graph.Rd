\usage{
build_drake_graph(plan = read_drake_plan(), targets = plan$target,
  envir = parent.frame(), verbose = drake::default_verbose(),
  jobs = 1, sanitize_plan = FALSE, console_log_file = NULL,
  trigger = drake::trigger(), cache = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{plan}{workflow plan data frame.
A workflow plan data frame is a data frame
with a \code{target} column and a \code{command} column.
(See the details in the \code{\link[=drake_plan]{drake_plan()}} help file
for descriptions of the optional columns.)
Targets are the objects and files that drake generates,
and commands are the pieces of R code that produce them.
Use the function \code{\link[=drake_plan]{drake_plan()}} to generate workflow plan
data frames easily, and see functions \code{\link[=plan_analyses]{plan_analyses()}},
\code{\link[=plan_summaries]{plan_summaries()}}, \code{\link[=evaluate_plan]{evaluate_plan()}},
\code{\link[=expand_plan]{expand_plan()}}, and \code{\link[=gather_plan]{gather_plan()}} for
easy ways to generate large workflow plan data frames.}

\item{targets}{character vector, names of targets to build.
Dependencies are built too. Together, the \code{plan} and
\code{targets} comprise the workflow network
(i.e. the \code{graph} argument).
Changing either will change the network.}

\item{envir}{environment to use. Defaults to the current
workspace, so you should not need to worry about this
most of the time. A deep copy of \code{envir} is made,
so you don't need to worry about your workspace being modified
by \code{make}. The deep copy inherits from the global environment.
Wherever necessary, objects and functions are imported
from \code{envir} and the global environment and
then reproducibly tracked as dependencies.}

\item{verbose}{logical or numeric, control printing to the console.
Use \code{pkgconfig} to set the default value of \code{verbose}
for your R session:
for example, \code{pkgconfig::set_config("drake::verbose" = 2)}.
\describe{
\item{0 or \code{FALSE}:}{print nothing.}
\item{1 or \code{TRUE}:}{print only targets to build.}
\item{2:}{in addition, print checks and cache info.}
\item{3:}{in addition, print any potentially missing items.}
\item{4:}{in addition, print imports. Full verbosity.}
}}

\item{jobs}{number of parallel processes or jobs to run.
See \code{\link[=predict_runtime]{predict_runtime()}}
to help figure out what the number of jobs should be.
Windows users should not set \code{jobs > 1} if
\code{parallelism} is \code{"mclapply"} because
\code{\link[=mclapply]{mclapply()}} is based on forking. Windows users
who use \code{parallelism = "Makefile"} will need to
download and install Rtools.

Imports and targets are processed separately, and they usually
have different parallelism needs. To use at most 2 jobs at a time
for imports and at most 4 jobs at a time for targets, call
\code{make(..., jobs = c(imports = 2, targets = 4))}.

If \code{parallelism} is \code{"Makefile"},  Makefile-level parallelism is
only used for targets in your workflow plan data frame, not imports.  To
process imported objects and files, drake selects the best parallel backend
for your system and uses the number of jobs you give to the \code{jobs}
argument to \code{\link[=make]{make()}}. To use at most 2 jobs for imports and at
most 4 jobs for targets, run
\code{make(..., parallelism = "Makefile", jobs = c(imports = 2, targets = 4))} or
\code{make(..., parallelism = "Makefile", jobs = 2, args = "--jobs=4")}.}

\item{sanitize_plan}{logical, deprecated. If you must,
call \code{drake:::sanitize_plan()} to sanitize the plan
and/or \code{drake:::sanitize_targets()} to sanitize the targets
(or just get \code{plan} and \code{targets} and \code{graph} from
\code{\link[=drake_config]{drake_config()}}).}

\item{console_log_file}{character scalar or \code{NULL}.
If \code{NULL}, console output will be printed
to the R console using \code{message()}.
Otherwise, \code{console_log_file} should be the name of a flat file.
Console output will be appended to that file.}

\item{trigger}{optional, a global trigger for building targets
(see \code{\link[=trigger]{trigger()}}).}

\item{cache}{an optional \code{storr} cache for memoization}
}
\value{
An igraph object representing
the workflow plan dependency network.
}
\description{
This function returns an igraph object representing how
the targets in your workflow plan data frame
depend on each other.
(\code{help(package = "igraph")}). To plot this graph, call
to \code{\link[=plot.igraph]{plot.igraph()}} on your graph. See the online manual
for enhanced graph visualization functionality.
}
\examples{
\dontrun{
test_with_dir("Quarantine side effects.", {
load_mtcars_example() # Get the code with drake_example("mtcars").
# Make the igraph network connecting all the targets and imports.
g <- build_drake_graph(my_plan)
class(g) # "igraph"
})
