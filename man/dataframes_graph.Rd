\arguments{
\item{plan}{workflow plan data frame, same as for function
\code{\link{make}()}.}

\item{targets}{names of targets to build, same as for function
\code{\link{make}()}.}

\item{envir}{environment to import from, same as for function
\code{\link{make}()}. \code{config$envir} is ignored in favor
of \code{envir}.}

\item{verbose}{logical, whether to output messages to the console.}

\item{hook}{same as for \code{\link{make}}}

\item{cache}{optional drake cache. Only used if the \code{config}
argument is \code{NULL} (default). See code{\link{new_cache}()}.}

\item{jobs}{The \code{outdated()} function is called internally,
and it needs to import objects and examine your
input files to see what has been updated. This could take some time,
and parallel computing may be needed
to speed up the process. The \code{jobs} argument is number of parallel jobs
to use for faster computation.}

\item{parallelism}{Choice of parallel backend to speed up the computation.
Execution order in \code{\link{make}()} is slightly different when
\code{parallelism} equals \code{'Makefile'}
because in that case, all the imports are imported
before any target is built.
Thus, the arrangement in the graph is different for Makefile parallelism.
See \code{?parallelism_choices} for details.}

\item{packages}{same as for \code{\link{make}}}

\item{prework}{same as for \code{\link{make}}}

\item{build_times}{logical, whether to show the \code{\link{build_times}()}
of the targets and imports, if available.
These are just elapsed times from \code{system.time()}.}

\item{digits}{number of digits for rounding the build times}

\item{targets_only}{logical,
whether to skip the imports and only include the
targets in the workflow plan.}

\item{split_columns}{logical, whether to break up the
columns of nodes to make the aspect ratio of the rendered
graph closer to 1:1. This improves the viewing experience,
but the columns no longer strictly represent parallelizable
stages of build items. (Although the targets/imports
in each column are still conditionally independent,
there may be more conditional independence than the graph
indicates.)}

\item{font_size}{numeric, font size of the node labels in the graph}

\item{config}{option internal runtime parameter list of
\code{\link{make}(...)},
produced with \code{\link{config}()}.
\code{config$envir} is ignored.
Otherwise, computing this
in advance could save time if you plan multiple calls to
\code{dataframes_graph()}.
If not \code{NULL},
\code{config} overrides all arguments except
\code{build_times}, \code{digits}, \code{targets_only},
\code{split_columns}, and \code{font_size}.}

\item{from}{Optional collection of target/import names.
If \code{from} is nonempty,
the graph will restrict itself to
a neighborhood of \code{from}.
Control the neighborhood with
\code{mode} and \code{order}.}

\item{mode}{Which direction to branch out in the graph
to create a neighborhood around \code{from}.
Use \code{"in"} to go upstream,
\code{"out"} to go downstream,
and \code{"all"} to go both ways and disregard
edge direction altogether.}

\item{order}{How far to branch out to create
a neighborhood around \code{from} (measured
in the number of nodes). Defaults to
as far as possible.}

\item{subset}{Optional character vector of of target/import names.
Subset of nodes to display in the graph.
Applied after \code{from}, \code{mode}, and \code{order}.
Be advised: edges are only kept for adjacent nodes in \code{subset}.
If you do not select all the intermediate nodes,
edges will drop from the graph.}

\item{from_scratch}{logical, whether to assume that
all targets are out of date and the next \code{\link{make}()}
will happen from scratch. Setting to \code{TRUE} will prevent
the graph from showing you which targets are up to date,
but it makes computing the graph much faster.}
}
\value{
a list of three data frames: one for nodes,
one for edges, and one for
the legend/key nodes. The list also contains the
default title of the graph.
}
\description{
Get the information about nodes, edges, and the legend/key
so you can plot your own custom \code{visNetwork}.
