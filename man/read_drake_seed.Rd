\title{Read the pseudo-random number generator seed of the project.}
\usage{
read_drake_seed(path = getwd(), search = TRUE, cache = NULL,
  verbose = drake::default_verbose())
}
\arguments{
\item{path}{Root directory of the drake project,
or if \code{search} is \code{TRUE}, either the
project root or a subdirectory of the project.
Ignored if a \code{cache} is supplied.}

\item{search}{logical. If \code{TRUE}, search parent directories
to find the nearest drake cache. Otherwise, look in the
current working directory only.
Ignored if a \code{cache} is supplied.}

\item{cache}{drake cache. See \code{\link[=new_cache]{new_cache()}}.
If supplied, \code{path} and \code{search} are ignored.}

\item{verbose}{logical or numeric, control printing to the console.
Use \code{pkgconfig} to set the default value of \code{verbose}
for your R session:
for example, \code{pkgconfig::set_config("drake::verbose" = 2)}.
\describe{
\item{0 or \code{FALSE}:}{print nothing.}
\item{1 or \code{TRUE}:}{print only targets to build.}
\item{2:}{in addition, print checks and cache info.}
\item{3:}{in addition, print any potentially missing items.}
\item{4:}{in addition, print imports. Full verbosity.}
}}
}
\value{
An integer vector.
}
\description{
When a project is created with \code{\link[=make]{make()}}
or \code{\link[=drake_config]{drake_config()}}, the project's pseudo-random number generator
seed is cached. Then, unless the cache is destroyed,
the seeds of all the targets will deterministically depend on
this one central seed. That way, reproducibility is protected,
even under randomness.

# Same as before:

readd(target2, cache = cache)
# You can also supply a seed.
# If your project already exists, it must agree with the project's
# preexisting seed (default: 0)

read_drake_seed(cache = cache)
readd(target2, cache = cache)
# If you want to supply a different seed than 0,
# you need to destroy the cache and start over first.
