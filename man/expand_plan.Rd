\title{Create replicates of targets.}
\usage{
expand_plan(plan, values = NULL, rename = TRUE)
}
\arguments{
\item{plan}{workflow plan data frame}

\item{values}{values to expand over. These will be appended to
the names of the new targets.}

\item{rename}{logical, whether to rename the targets
based on the \code{values}. See the examples for a demo.}
}
\value{
An expanded workflow plan data frame (with replicated targets).
}
\description{
Duplicates the rows of a workflow plan data frame.
Prefixes are appended to the new target names
so targets still have unique names.
}
\examples{
# Create the part of the workflow plan for the datasets.
datasets <- drake_plan(
  small = simulate(5),
  large = simulate(50))
# Create replicates. If you want repeat targets,
# this is convenient.
expand_plan(datasets, values = c("rep1", "rep2", "rep3"))
# Choose whether to rename the targets based on the values.
expand_plan(datasets, values = 1:3, rename = TRUE)
expand_plan(datasets, values = 1:3, rename = FALSE)
