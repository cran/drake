\title{Function \code{status}}
\usage{
status(..., list = character(0), imported_files_only = FALSE,
  path = getwd(), search = TRUE)
}
\arguments{
\item{...}{objects to load from the cache, as names (unquoted)
or character strings (quoted). Similar to \code{...} in
\code{\link{remove}(...)}.}

\item{list}{character vector naming objects to be loaded from the
cache. Similar to the \code{list} argument of \code{\link{remove}()}.}

\item{imported_files_only}{logical, applies only when 
no targets are specified and the statuses of cached targets are 
returned.
If \code{imported_files_only} is \code{TRUE} and no targets are
specified in \code{...} or \code{list}, then \code{status()} 
shows the build status of targets (with commands) plus imported files,
ignoring imported objects. Otherwise, the full collection of 
statuses for 
all cached objects will be listed. Since all your functions and 
all their global variables are imported, the full list of
imported objects could get really cumbersome.}

\item{path}{Root directory of the drake project,
or if \code{search} is \code{TRUE}, either the
project root or a subdirectory of the project.}

\item{search}{If \code{TRUE}, search parent directories
to find the nearest drake cache. Otherwise, look in the
current working directory only.}
}
\value{
Either the build status of each target given (from the last
call to \code{\link{make}()} or \code{\link{make}()}), or if no 
targets are specified, a data frame containing the build status
of the last session. 
In the latter case, only finished targets are listed.

Either a named logical indicating whether the given
targets or cached or a character vector listing all cached
items, depending on whether any targets are specified
}
\description{
Get the build status (overall or individual targets)
of the last call to 
\code{\link{make}()} or \code{\link{make}()}. 
Objects that drake imported, built, or attempted
to build are listed as \code{"finished"} or \code{"in progress"}. 
Skipped objects are not listed.
