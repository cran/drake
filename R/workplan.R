#' @title Function \code{workplan}
#' @description Turns a named collection of command/target pairs into
#' a workflow plan data frame for \code{\link{make}} and
#' \code{\link{check}}.
#' @details A workflow plan data frame is a data frame
#' with a \code{target} column and a \code{command} column.
#' Targets are the objects and files that drake generates,
#' and commands are the pieces of R code that produce them.
#'
#' For file inputs and targets, drake uses single quotes.
#' Double quotes are reserved for ordinary strings.
#' The distinction is important because drake thinks about
#' how files, objects, targets, etc. depend on each other.
#' Quotes in the \code{list} argument are left alone,
#' but R messes with quotes when it parses the free-form
#' arguments in \code{...}, so use the \code{strings_in_dots}
#' argument to control the quoting in \code{...}.
#' @export
#' @return data frame of targets and command
#' @param ... same as for \code{drake::\link{workplan}()}
#' @param list same as for \code{drake::\link{workplan}()}

#' @title Function \code{as_file}

#' @param x character string to be turned into a filename
#' understandable by drake (i.e., a string with literal
#' single quotes on both ends).
#' @examples
