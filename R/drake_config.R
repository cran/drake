#' @title Interpret the plan and prepare for [make()]
#' \lifecycle{maturing}
#' @description [drake_config()] does all the preprocessing that
#'   [make()] needs to build targets. This includes interpreting
#'   the plan (from [drake_plan()]) and analyzing how all the
#'   targets fit together. The result is a list of objects
#'   that [make()] needs to keep track of everything during runtime.
#' @details Once you create a list with [drake_config()],
#'   do not modify it by hand.
#'
#'   Utility functions such as [outdated()],
#'   [vis_drake_graph()], and [predict_runtime()] require output from
#'   [drake_config()] for the `config` argument.
#'   If you supply a [drake_config()] object to the `config`
#'   argument of [make()], then `drake` will ignore all the other arguments
#'   because it already has everything it needs in `config`.
#' @inheritSection recoverable Recovery
#' @export
#' @return The master internal configuration list of a project.
#' @seealso [make()], [drake_plan()], [vis_drake_graph()]
#' @param plan Workflow plan data frame.
#'   A workflow plan data frame is a data frame
#'   with a `target` column and a `command` column.
#'   (See the details in the [drake_plan()] help file
#'   for descriptions of the optional columns.)
#'   Targets are the objects that drake generates,
#'   and commands are the pieces of R code that produce them.
#'   You can create and track custom files along the way
#'   (see [file_in()], [file_out()], and [knitr_in()]).
#'   Use the function [drake_plan()] to generate workflow plan
#'   data frames.
#'
#' @param targets Character vector, names of targets to build.
#'   Dependencies are built too. Together, the `plan` and
#'   `targets` comprise the workflow network
#'   (i.e. the `graph` argument).
#'   Changing either will change the network.
#'
#' @param envir Environment to use. Defaults to the current
#'   workspace, so you should not need to worry about this
#'   most of the time. A deep copy of `envir` is made,
#'   so you don't need to worry about your workspace being modified
#'   by `make`. The deep copy inherits from the global environment.
#'   Wherever necessary, objects and functions are imported
#'   from `envir` and the global environment and
#'   then reproducibly tracked as dependencies.
#'
#' @param verbose Integer, control printing to the console/terminal.
#'   - `0`: print nothing.
#'   - `1`: print targets, retries, and failures.
#'   - `2`: also show a spinner when preprocessing tasks are underway.
#'
#' @param hook Deprecated.
#'
#' @param skip_targets Logical, whether to skip building the targets
#'   in `plan` and just import objects and files.
#'
#' @param parallelism Character scalar, type of parallelism to use.
#'   For detailed explanations, see the
#'   [high-performance computing chapter](https://books.ropensci.org/drake/hpc.html) # nolint
#'   of the user manual.
#'
#'   You could also supply your own scheduler function
#'   if you want to experiment or aggressively optimize.
#'   The function should take a single `config` argument
#'   (produced by [drake_config()]). Existing examples
#'   from `drake`'s internals are the `backend_*()` functions:
#'   - `backend_loop()`
#'   - `backend_clustermq()`
#'   - `backend_future()`
#'   However, this functionality is really a back door
#'   and should not be used for production purposes unless you really
#'   know what you are doing and you are willing to suffer setbacks
#'   whenever `drake`'s unexported core functions are updated.
#'
#' @param jobs Maximum number of parallel workers for processing the targets.
#'   You can experiment with [predict_runtime()]
#'   to help decide on an appropriate number of jobs.
#'   For details, visit
#'   <https://books.ropensci.org/drake/time.html>.
#'
#' @param jobs_preprocess Number of parallel jobs for processing the imports
#'   and doing other preprocessing tasks.
#'
#' @param packages Character vector packages to load, in the order
#'   they should be loaded. Defaults to `rev(.packages())`, so you
#'   should not usually need to set this manually. Just call
#'   [library()] to load your packages before `make()`.
#'   However, sometimes packages need to be strictly forced to load
#'   in a certain order, especially if `parallelism` is
#'   `"Makefile"`. To do this, do not use [library()]
#'   or [require()] or [loadNamespace()] or
#'   [attachNamespace()] to load any libraries beforehand.
#'   Just list your packages in the `packages` argument in the order
#'   you want them to be loaded.
#'
#' @param lib_loc Character vector, optional.
#'   Same as in `library()` or `require()`.
#'   Applies to the `packages` argument (see above).
#'
#' @param prework Expression (language object), list of expressions,
#'   or character vector.
#'   Code to run right before targets build.
#'   Called only once if `parallelism` is `"loop"`
#'   and once per target otherwise.
#'   This code can be used to set global options, etc.
#'
#' @param prepend Deprecated.
#' @param command Deprecated.
#' @param args Deprecated.
#' @param recipe_command Deprecated.
#'
#' @param log_progress Logical, whether to log the progress
#'   of individual targets as they are being built. Progress logging
#'   creates extra files in the cache (usually the `.drake/` folder)
#'   and slows down `make()` a little.
#'   If you need to reduce or limit the number of files in the cache,
#'   call `make(log_progress = FALSE, recover = FALSE)`.
#'
#' @param cache drake cache as created by [new_cache()].
#'   See also [drake_cache()].
#'
#' @param fetch_cache Deprecated.
#'
#' @param timeout `deprecated`. Use `elapsed` and `cpu` instead.
#'
#' @param cpu Same as the `cpu` argument of `setTimeLimit()`.
#'   Seconds of cpu time before a target times out.
#'   Assign target-level cpu timeout times with an optional `cpu`
#'   column in `plan`.
#'
#' @param elapsed Same as the `elapsed` argument of `setTimeLimit()`.
#'   Seconds of elapsed time before a target times out.
#'   Assign target-level elapsed timeout times with an optional `elapsed`
#'   column in `plan`.
#'
#' @param retries Number of retries to execute if the target fails.
#'   Assign target-level retries with an optional `retries`
#'   column in `plan`.
#'
#' @param force Logical. If `FALSE` (default) then `drake`
#'   imposes checks if the cache was created with an old
#'   and incompatible version of drake.
#'   If there is an incompatibility, `make()` stops to
#'   give you an opportunity to
#'   downgrade `drake` to a compatible version
#'   rather than rerun all your targets from scratch.
#'
#' @param graph An `igraph` object from the previous `make()`.
#'   Supplying a pre-built graph could save time.
#'
#' @param trigger Name of the trigger to apply to all targets.
#'   Ignored if `plan` has a `trigger` column.
#'   See [trigger()] for details.
#'
#' @param skip_imports Logical, whether to totally neglect to
#'   process the imports and jump straight to the targets. This can be useful
#'   if your imports are massive and you just want to test your project,
#'   but it is bad practice for reproducible data analysis.
#'   This argument is overridden if you supply your own `graph` argument.
#'
#' @param skip_safety_checks Logical, whether to skip the safety checks
#'   on your workflow. Use at your own peril.
#'
#' @param lazy_load Either a character vector or a logical. Choices:
#'   - `"eager"`: no lazy loading. The target is loaded right away
#'     with [assign()].
#'   - `"promise"`: lazy loading with [delayedAssign()]
#'   - `"bind"`: lazy loading with active bindings:
#'     `bindr::populate_env()`.
#'   - `TRUE`: same as `"promise"`.
#'   - `FALSE`: same as `"eager"`.
#'
#'   If `lazy_load` is `"eager"`,
#'   drake prunes the execution environment before each target/stage,
#'   removing all superfluous targets
#'   and then loading any dependencies it will need for building.
#'   In other words, drake prepares the environment in advance
#'   and tries to be memory efficient.
#'   If `lazy_load` is `"bind"` or `"promise"`, drake assigns
#'   promises to load any dependencies at the last minute.
#'   Lazy loading may be more memory efficient in some use cases, but
#'   it may duplicate the loading of dependencies, costing time.
#'
#' @param session_info Logical, whether to save the `sessionInfo()`
#'   to the cache. This behavior is recommended for serious [make()]s
#'   for the sake of reproducibility. This argument only exists to
#'   speed up tests. Apparently, `sessionInfo()` is a bottleneck
#'   for small [make()]s.
#'
#' @param cache_log_file Name of the CSV cache log file to write.
#'   If `TRUE`, the default file name is used (`drake_cache.CSV`).
#'   If `NULL`, no file is written.
#'   If activated, this option writes a flat text file
#'   to represent the state of the cache
#'   (fingerprints of all the targets and imports).
#'   If you put the log file under version control, your commit history
#'   will give you an easy representation of how your results change
#'   over time as the rest of your project changes. Hopefully,
#'   this is a step in the right direction for data reproducibility.
#'
#' @param seed Integer, the root pseudo-random number generator
#'   seed to use for your project.
#'   In [make()], `drake` generates a unique
#'   local seed for each target using the global seed
#'   and the target name. That way, different pseudo-random numbers
#'   are generated for different targets, and this pseudo-randomness
#'   is reproducible.
#'
#'   To ensure reproducibility across different R sessions,
#'   `set.seed()` and `.Random.seed` are ignored and have no affect on
#'   `drake` workflows. Conversely, `make()` does not usually
#'   change `.Random.seed`,
#'   even when pseudo-random numbers are generated.
#'   The exception to this last point is
#'   `make(parallelism = "clustermq")`
#'   because the `clustermq` package needs to generate random numbers
#'   to set up ports and sockets for ZeroMQ.
#'
#'   On the first call to `make()` or `drake_config()`, `drake`
#'   uses the random number generator seed from the `seed` argument.
#'   Here, if the `seed` is `NULL` (default), `drake` uses a `seed` of `0`.
#'   On subsequent `make()`s for existing projects, the project's
#'   cached seed will be used in order to ensure reproducibility.
#'   Thus, the `seed` argument must either be `NULL` or the same
#'   seed from the project's cache (usually the `.drake/` folder).
#'   To reset the random number generator seed for a project,
#'   use `clean(destroy = TRUE)`.
#'
#' @param caching Character string, either `"master"` or `"worker"`.
#'   - `"master"`: Targets are built by remote workers and sent back to
#'     the master process. Then, the master process saves them to the
#'     cache (`config$cache`, usually a file system `storr`).
#'     Appropriate if remote workers do not have access to the file system
#'     of the calling R session. Targets are cached one at a time,
#'     which may be slow in some situations.
#'   - `"worker"`: Remote workers not only build the targets, but also
#'     save them to the cache. Here, caching happens in parallel.
#'     However, remote workers need to have access to the file system
#'     of the calling R session. Transferring target data across
#'     a network can be slow.
#'
#' @param keep_going Logical, whether to still keep running [make()]
#'   if targets fail.
#'
#' @param session Deprecated. Has no effect now.
#'
#' @param pruning_strategy Deprecated. See `memory_strategy`.
#'
#' @param memory_strategy Character scalar, name of the
#'   strategy `drake` uses to load/unload a target's dependencies in memory.
#'   You can give each target its own memory strategy,
#'   (e.g. `drake_plan(x = 1, y = target(f(x), memory_strategy = "lookahead"))`)
#'   to override the global memory strategy. Choices:
#'
#' - `"speed"`: Once a target is newly built or loaded in memory,
#'   just keep it there.
#'   This choice maximizes speed and hogs memory.
#' - `"autoclean"`: Just before building each new target,
#'   unload everything from memory except the target's direct dependencies.
#'   After a target is built, discard it from memory.
#'   (Set `garbage_collection = TRUE` to make sure it is really gone.)
#'   This option conserves memory, but it sacrifices speed because
#'   each new target needs to reload
#'   any previously unloaded targets from storage.
#' - `"preclean"`: Just before building each new target,
#'   unload everything from memory except the target's direct dependencies.
#'   After a target is built, keep it in memory until `drake` determines
#'   they can be unloaded.
#'   This option conserves memory, but it sacrifices speed because
#'   each new target needs to reload
#'   any previously unloaded targets from storage.
#' - `"lookahead"`: Just before building each new target,
#'   search the dependency graph to find targets that will not be
#'   needed for the rest of the current `make()` session.
#'   After a target is built, keep it in memory until the next
#'   memory management stage.
#'   In this mode, targets are only in memory if they need to be loaded,
#'   and we avoid superfluous reads from the cache.
#'   However, searching the graph takes time,
#'   and it could even double the computational overhead for large projects.
#' - `"unload"`: Just before building each new target,
#'   unload all targets from memory.
#'   After a target is built, **do not** keep it in memory.
#'   This mode aggressively optimizes for both memory and speed,
#'   but in commands and triggers,
#'   you have to manually load any dependencies you need using `readd()`.
#' - `"none"`: Do not manage memory at all.
#'   Do not load or unload anything before building targets.
#'   After a target is built, **do not** keep it in memory.
#'   This mode aggressively optimizes for both memory and speed,
#'   but in commands and triggers,
#'   you have to manually load any dependencies you need using `readd()`.
#'
#' For even more direct
#' control over which targets `drake` keeps in memory, see the
#' help file examples of [drake_envir()].
#' Also see the `garbage_collection` argument of `make()` and
#' `drake_config()`.
#'
#' @param makefile_path Deprecated.
#'
#' @param console_log_file Optional character scalar of a file name or
#'   connection object (such as `stdout()`) to dump maximally verbose
#'   log information for [make()] and other functions (all functions that
#'   accept a `config` argument, plus `drake_config()`).
#'   If you choose to use a text file as the console log,
#'   it will persist over multiple function calls
#'   until you delete it manually.
#'   Fields in each row the log file, from left to right:
#'       - The node name (short host name) of the
#'         computer (from `Sys.info()["nodename"]`).
#'       - The process ID (from `Sys.getpid()`).
#'       - A timestamp with the date and time (in microseconds).
#'       - A brief description of what `drake` was doing.`
#'   The fields are separated by pipe symbols (`"|"`).
#'
#' @param ensure_workers Deprecated.
#'
#' @param garbage_collection Logical, whether to call `gc()` each time
#'   a target is built during [make()].
#'
#' @param template A named list of values to fill in the `{{ ... }}`
#'   placeholders in template files (e.g. from [drake_hpc_template_file()]).
#'   Same as the `template` argument of `clustermq::Q()` and
#'   `clustermq::workers`.
#'   Enabled for `clustermq` only (`make(parallelism = "clustermq")`),
#'   not `future` or `batchtools` so far.
#'   For more information, see the `clustermq` package:
#'   <https://github.com/mschubert/clustermq>.
#'   Some template placeholders such as `{{ job_name }}` and `{{ n_jobs }}`
#'   cannot be set this way.
#'
#' @param sleep Optional function on a single numeric argument `i`.
#'   Default: `function(i) 0.01`.
#'
#'   To conserve memory, `drake` assigns a brand new closure to
#'   `sleep`, so your custom function should not depend on in-memory data
#'   except from loaded packages.
#'
#'   For parallel processing, `drake` uses
#'   a central master process to check what the parallel
#'   workers are doing, and for the affected high-performance
#'   computing workflows, wait for data to arrive over a network.
#'   In between loop iterations, the master process sleeps to avoid throttling.
#'   The `sleep` argument to `make()` and `drake_config()`
#'   allows you to customize how much time the master process spends
#'   sleeping.
#'
#'   The `sleep` argument is a function that takes an argument
#'   `i` and returns a numeric scalar, the number of seconds to
#'   supply to `Sys.sleep()` after iteration `i` of checking.
#'   (Here, `i` starts at 1.)
#'   If the checking loop does something other than sleeping
#'   on iteration `i`, then `i` is reset back to 1.
#'
#'   To sleep for the same amount of time between checks,
#'   you might supply something like `function(i) 0.01`.
#'   But to avoid consuming too many resources during heavier
#'   and longer workflows, you might use an exponential
#'   back-off: say,
#'   `function(i) { 0.1 + 120 * pexp(i - 1, rate = 0.01) }`.
#'
#' @param hasty_build A user-defined function.
#'   In "hasty mode" (`make(parallelism = "hasty")`)
#'   this is the function that evaluates a target's command
#'   and returns the resulting value. The `hasty_build` argument
#'   has no effect if `parallelism` is any value other than "hasty".
#'
#'   The function you pass to `hasty_build` must have arguments `target`
#'   and `config`. Here, `target` is a character scalar naming the
#'   target being built, and `config` is a configuration list of
#'   runtime parameters generated by [drake_config()].
#'
#' @param layout `config$layout`, where `config` is the return value
#'   from a prior call to `drake_config()`. If your plan or environment
#'   have changed since the last `make()`, do not supply a `layout` argument.
#'   Otherwise, supplying one could save time.
#'
#' @param lock_envir Logical, whether to lock `config$envir` during `make()`.
#'   If `TRUE`, `make()` quits in error whenever a command in your
#'   `drake` plan (or `prework`) tries to add, remove, or modify
#'   non-hidden variables in your environment/workspace/R session.
#'   This is extremely important for ensuring the purity of your functions
#'   and the reproducibility/credibility/trust you can place in your project.
#'   `lock_envir` will be set to a default of `TRUE` in `drake` version
#'   7.0.0 and higher.
#'
#' @param history Logical, whether to record the build history
#'   of your targets. You can also supply a
#'   [`txtq`](https://github.com/wlandau/txtq), which is
#'   how `drake` records history.
#'   Must be `TRUE` for [drake_history()] to work later.
#'
#' @param recover Logical, whether to activate automated data recovery.
#'   The default is `FALSE` because
#'
#'   1. Automated data recovery is still experimental.
#'   2. It has reproducibility issues.
#'   Targets recovered from the distant past may have been generated
#'   with earlier versions of R and earlier package environments
#'   that no longer exist.
#'
#'   How it works: if `recover` is `TRUE`,
#'   `drake` tries to salvage old target values from the cache
#'   instead of running commands from the plan.
#'   A target is recoverable if
#'
#'   1. There is an old value somewhere in the cache that
#'      shares the command, dependencies, etc.
#'      of the target about to be built.
#'   2. The old value was generated with `make(recoverable = TRUE)`.
#'
#'   If both conditions are met, `drake` will
#'
#'   1. Assign the most recently-generated admissible data to the target, and
#'   2. skip the target's command.
#'
#'   Functions [recoverable()] and [r_recoverable()] show the most upstream
#'   outdated targets that will be recovered in this way in the next
#'   [make()] or [r_make()].
#'
#' @param recoverable Logical, whether to make target values recoverable
#'   with `make(recover = TRUE)`.
#'   This requires writing extra files to the cache,
#'   and it prevents old metadata from being removed with garbage collection
#'   (`clean(garbage_collection = TRUE)`, `gc()` in `storr`s).
#'   If you need to limit the cache size or the number of files in the cache,
#'   consider `make(recoverable = FALSE, progress = FALSE)`.
#'
#' @param curl_handles A named list of curl handles. Each value is an
#'   object from `curl::new_handle()`, and each name is a URL
#'   (and should start with "http", "https", or "ftp").
#'   Example:
#'   list(
#'     `http://httpbin.org/basic-auth` = curl::new_handle(
#'       username = "user", password = "passwd"
#'     )
#'   )
#'   Then, if your plan has
#'   `file_in("http://httpbin.org/basic-auth/user/passwd")`
#'   `drake` will authenticate using the username and password of the handle
#'   for `http://httpbin.org/basic-auth/`.
#'
#'   `drake` uses partial matching on text to
#'   find the right handle of the `file_in()` URL, so the name of the handle
#'   could be the complete URL (`"http://httpbin.org/basic-auth/user/passwd"`)
#'   or a part of the URL (e.g. `"http://httpbin.org/"` or
#'   `"http://httpbin.org/basic-auth/"`). If you have multiple handles
#'   whose names match your URL, `drake` will choose the closest match.
#'
#' @param max_expand Positive integer, optional.
#'   `max_expand` is the maximum number of targets to generate in each
#'   `map()`, `cross()`, or `group()` dynamic transform.
#'   Useful if you have a massive number of dynamic sub-targets and you want to
#'   work with only the first few sub-targets before scaling up.
#'   Note: the `max_expand` argument of `make()` and
#'   `drake_config()` is for dynamic branching only.
#'   The static branching `max_expand`
#'   is an argument of `drake_plan()` and `transform_plan()`.
